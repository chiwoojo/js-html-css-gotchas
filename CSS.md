"Animating the scale, rotation, and position of an element is incredibly common. In CSS, they're all crammed into one "transform" property, making them impossible to animate in a truly distinct way on a single element."

"For simple transitions between two states (i.e. rollovers or expanding menus, etc.), CSS Transitions are great. For sequencing things, however, you generally need to use CSS keyframe animations which force you to define things in percentages"
